    "KNN regression has its benefits—it’s simple to understand and can capture complex, nonlinear relationships in data. It works well when the data has patterns that are best explained by nearby neighbors. However, KNN regression also has its downsides. It struggles to make predictions for values outside the range of the training data, meaning it can’t effectively handle cases where the target variable extends beyond what’s been observed. Additionally, as the dataset grows larger, KNN becomes computationally slower since it has to calculate distances for every new prediction.\n",
    " \n",
    "Because of these limitations, especially when we need to generalize beyond the training data or handle larger datasets more efficiently, we often turn to linear regression as an alternative. Linear regression offers a more scalable approach and provides a way to make predictions across a wider range of values.\n",

    "Linear regression is a method to find the best straight line that shows the relationship between two things. For example, if you have data about how much time students spend studying and their test scores, linear regression will help you draw a line to show how study time affects scores. The line helps us see the overall pattern—students who study more tend to get better scores—and allows us to predict test scores based on study time. It’s called \"linear\" because it shows a straight-line relationship between the two things.\n",

We then applied cross-validation to the entire dataset to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data, ensuring that the model's performance was not dependent on a single train-test split.\n",
